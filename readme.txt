Keep your community safe from predators on Twitter by turning your WordPress blog into a Predator Alert Tool for Twitter facilitation server.

== Description ==

Predator Alert Tool for Twitter empowers you to document harassment on Twitter and alert others about predatory users. What constitutes "predatory" is entirely up to you; the software makes no claim as to what behavior hurts you. Predator Alert Tool for Twitter can be used to, for example, flag trolls, [warn your followers about rapists](https://apps.facebook.com/predator-alert-tool/), or to [expose cops and snitches who use social media](https://apps.facebook.com/cop-block-tool/). Moreover, what you share can not be censored or removed by Twitter itself because Twitter is never informed of your report.

Predator Alert Tool for Twitter is part of [an Internet-wide anti-abuse effort](http://days.maybemaimed.com/post/69212634122/predator-alert-tool-co-creators-aim-to-build-sexual):

> The "report abuse" button on websites shouldn't go to the site admins. It should go to the rest of the user community.

This plugin implements the public domain [Predator Alert Tool for Twitter server component](https://github.com/meitar/pat-twitter/) as a WordPress plugin, turning your blog into a "PAT-Twitter facilitator" so you can help protect your community from the people who threaten or harm you.

Currently, the plugin provides only those functions available in the standard component, but patches to extend that functionality are welcome.
